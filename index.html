                <h1>Hercules or Herakles?</h1>
                <p>Hercules is what the Roman’s called their version of the
                    ancient demi-god Greek hero Herakles. Herakles is by far
                    one of the most famous ancient Greek mythological characters
                    to exist. As a legendary hero, Herakles was popular in both
                    the Greek and Roman societies within their legends. So
                    depending on the location in question is how you will know
                    what to refer to him as. <br>
                    <br> Herakles was often depicted as a
                    sizeable man with unbelievable
                    strength, he had a massive appetite, was an avid drinker, was
                    passionate, and considerably kind, but he had these aggressive
                    outbursts of mania and furry which flawed him and his life.

                <h1>Herakles’ Beginnings</h1>
                <p>Zeus has given a son to Alcmene, the granddaughter of Perseus,
                    Herakles, and declared the next male Perseus descendent would be
                    the ruler of Greece. His wife, Hera became jealous of his affair
                    and played a trick on Zeus by giving Alcmene twin boys, Eurystheus
                    was the first born and thus became king of Greece over Herakles. <br>
                    <br>As the younger brother to the king Eurystheus, Herakles had
                    to serve Eurystheus, and he had to battle against the bitter torment
                    of Hera. Eventually, Herakles became a war hero for his role in the
                    war against Orchomenus in Boeotia.<br>
                    <br>From this success Thebesian king Creon wed his daughter Megara
                    to Herakles. Sadly, their love story ended in tragedy when he was
                    hit with a fit of rage sent by Hera and he murdered Megara along
                    with all their children. This event forced him to become the servant
                    for his older brother king Eurystheus, and he would become the one
                    who implemented the Labours onto Herakles.

                <h1>The Twelve Labours</h1>
                <p>1. First he slayed the Nemean lion.<br>
                    2. Second he slayed the nine-headed hydra of Lerna.<br>
                    3. Third he went to Arcadia to capture the elusive hind.<br>
                    4. Fourth he captured a wild boar on Mount Erymanthus. <br>
                    5. Next he was tasked with cleaning all of the cattle stables of King Augeas of Elis in a single
                    day.<br>
                    6. After that he went to the marshes of the Stymphalian to shoot and kill the man-eating birds.<br>
                    7. Following that he ended the terror on the island of Crete by catching the mad bull.<br>
                    8. Next he went to King Diomedes of the Bistones to capture the man-eating mares.<br>
                    9. After that he stole the girdle of Hippolyte from the queen of the Amazons.<br>
                    10. For his tenth labour he went to the far west islands of Ertheia and took the cattle of the ruler
                    Geryon.<br>
                    11. Following that he had to retrieve the golden apples being kept by Hesperides at the end of the
                    world.<br>
                    12. Finally Herakles concluded his labours with his most dangerous labour, to kidnap the guardian of
                    the gates to the underworld Cerberus, a three-headed dog.</p>

                <h1>Disney’s Version</h1>
                <p>In the more modern take on the Herakles myth Disney
                    created Disney’s Hercules which is an animated film
                    loosely based on the myth of Herakles. They summarise
                    the plot as follows: <br>
                    “Taken from the gods as a newborn and adopted on earth,
                    Hercules became an awkward teenage pillar of strength.
                    He discovers he has a place on Mount Olympus with his
                    dad Zeus-if he can endure his growing pains and more
                    from “zero” to true hero, along with Pegasus, the flying
                    stallion, and Phil, a feisty personal trainer, Hercules
                    is on a mission to stick it to Hades once and for all.” <br>
                    <br> A few of the differences between the film and myth
                    include but are not limited to these; Hades is the villain
                    in Disney’s version of the story while Hera is the villain
                    in the myth; Hercules was found as an infant by his earth
                    parents and was a god turned mortal in the animated film,
                    while he was born as a twin and a demi-god in the original
                    myth; Hercules must prove himself and his heart to be a true
                    hero by achieving tasks to be re-instated as a god on Mount
                    Olympus, while the true intention of his tasks were labours
                    that his brother forced upon him to make up for his wrong
                    doings in life.

                <h1>What's Missing?</h1>
                <p>There are many fun Greek mythology easter eggs that
                    can be spotted throughout the animated film Disney’s
                    Hercules and their character designs were ingenious and
                    clever to include various pieces of the original myth.
                    Although these are the only bits of the film that are at
                    all accurate to the ancient myth. The animated film almost
                    doesn’t even touch on the meaning behind the Herakles myth,
                    being flawed and making mistakes is okay, if you work towards
                    bettering your wrongs.</p>

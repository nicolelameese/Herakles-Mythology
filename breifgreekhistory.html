                        <p>Ancient Greek society was a thriving society starting with
                            the Mycenaeans from 1200 BCE, concluding with the death of
                            Alexander the Great in 323 CE. During these times people
                            viewed myths as some view the bible by connecting historical
                            events to mythological stories, including the myth of Herakles.

                    <p>Herakles is a great hero and although he has done some unforgivable
                        things as we see through a modern day lends, those things could be
                        acts that were eventually forgiven. Herakles was and still is a poster
                        boy for correcting your wrongs and that actions speak louder than words.<br>
                        <br>He makes a phenomenal role model as he is not a perfect individual,
                        he makes mistakes and is flawed but he is constantly working on himself
                        to improve and make up for his wrong doings.

                <h1>Mythology & Legends</h1>
                <p>Legends and myths can be classified independently, mythologists
                    call more traditional stories legends while earlier stories set in
                    the cosmos or include gods as main characters are seen as myths.
                    During the Hellenistic age scholars began to write down their oral
                    histories and many mythologists see these writings as myths or legends
                    due to a lack of categories that these writings can fall into in the
                    academia world. Histories and researchers should find a way to categorise
                    the myths and stories they are studying, as written oral stories must not
                    be interpreted literally.<br>
                    <br>Oral traditions that were later written down are the only things that is
                    surviving when it comes to records and documentation of ‘oral histories’
                    as anyone who knew the original oral story or historical event has
                    departed. Many writers of the time combined parts of oral stories of
                    myths and legends to the written histories of events that took place,
                    making it difficult to look at the works now and make an completely
                    accurate analysis of what was being described and if it was all true.

                <h1>Euripides</h1>
                <p>Euripides was from Salamis Island who became a playwright with stories and
                    themes rooted in philosophical thought. He wrote a play about the myth of
                    Herakles portraying his internal turmoil following his fits of rage and
                    madness. He was most famously known as a “philosopher of the stage” due
                    to his deeper look on feelings and emotions on commonly known stories/myths.</p>

                <h1>Apollodorus</h1>
                <p>Apollodorus was a Greek scholar and historian who lived from roughly
                    180 – 120 BCE (Before Common Era). He wrote down many stories from
                    popular or common myths of the times in a collection called The
                    Library. He also wrote down a detailed account of the Herakles myth,
                    labours, and challenges.</p>

                <h1>Diodorus Siculus</h1>
                <p>Diodorus Siculus was a historian from Sicily and wrote a forty-book
                    series, Bibliotheke (“The Library”), covering the known history
                    from the tome of creation until roughly 90 BCE. During his written
                    recording of history, he wrote of many Greek myths and tried to
                    rationalize the myth of Herakles into true historical events that
                    happened.</p>

            <h1>Herakles Myth Fun Fact</h1>
            <p> Herakles was always a hero, his first brave feat was against
                two serpents that were sent by his jealous and spiteful step-mother
                Hera to kill him in his cradle. Herakles, even as a baby, proved
                himself to be capable of anything when he was successful in his
                first battle.

            <h1>Herakles Labours Fun Fact</h1>
            <p>Herakles should have only had ten labours not twelve,
                but two of them didn’t count. His brother, King
                Eurystheus, decided that two of the tasks he had
                completed were not done correctly. <br>
                Firstly, when Herakles was tasked to slay the Hydra,
                it was as a solo task, but his nephew Iolaus assisted
                him making that Labour invalid as he had not done this
                one by himself. Secondly, while Herakles was cleaning
                the horse stables for King Augeas of Elis, he diverged
                the river to help clean the stables and accepted monetary
                payment for his labour. Eurystheus decided due to these
                two things that these labours also did not count. <br>
                Herakles taking the easy way out in those two scenarios
                backfired on him and ended up creating more work for
                himself in the end, by him having to complete twelve
                instead of ten labours. If not for those two labours
                being disqualified Herakles would have finished his
                labours when he stole Geryon’s cattle.

                <h1>Famous Writers Fun Facts</h1>
                <p>1. The book written by Apollodorus, The Library, is a great
                    resource for anyone looking for further first hand
                    information about ancient Greek mythologies.</p>
                <p>2. Euripides was known as a prolific
                    playwrite with endless creativity having
                    written roughly eighty to ninty plays during
                    his lifetime. Sadly, only nineteen of those plays
                    have survived.</p>

                    The Mythology Guy is a YouTuber that made a video discussing all the inaccuracies between Disney's
                    Hercules and the twelve labours of Herakles myth. He goes through the entire Disney film discussing
                    all the things that are wrong in the animated version of the story.
